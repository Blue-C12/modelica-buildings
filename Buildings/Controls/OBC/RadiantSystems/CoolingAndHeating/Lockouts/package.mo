This package contains the radiant slab lockout control blocks, which indicate when heating or cooling of the radiant slab is locked out.
<li> This includes a single block, which combines all lockouts, and a sublockouts package, which includes each individual lockout on its own. 
<li> Lockouts are due to out-of-range room air temperature (for heating or cooling), hysteresis (for heating or cooling), 
<li> chilled water return temperature (for cooling), and night flush (for heating).
