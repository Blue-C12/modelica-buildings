  <li> The three validation models included in this package are as follows:
    <p>
   <li>1. ControlPlusLockout demonstrates radiant control based on 
  dummy inputs
   <li>2. ControlPlusLockoutPerimeter demonstrates radiant control for a simple perimeter room model
  <li> served by a radiant slab, with a simple hot water source, cold water source, and associated valves and pumps. 
 <li>3. ControlPlusLockoutPerimeter demonstrates radiant control for a simple core room model 
  <li> (i.e., no surfaces exposed to the outdoors)
